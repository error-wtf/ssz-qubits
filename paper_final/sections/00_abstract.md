# Abstract

Segmented Spacetime (SSZ) theory proposes that the gravitational potential couples to quantum phase as a deterministic, geometry-dependent drift rather than as random noise. This paper unifies and extends the series of manuscripts on SSZ to provide a comprehensive theoretical, experimental and practical treatment of gravitational phase coupling in quantum systems.

We derive the SSZ time-dilation formula from first principles, showing that the segment density Ξ(r) = r_s/(2r) leads to a differential time dilation ΔD = r_s·Δh/R² between qubits at different heights. The resulting phase drift ΔΦ = ω·ΔD·t scales linearly with frequency, height difference, and time.

We identify the scaling signatures that discriminate SSZ from conventional sources of dephasing:
- Height scaling: constant slope ∂ΔΦ/∂Δh
- Frequency scaling: linear in ω
- Time scaling: linear in t
- Compensation reversal: only SSZ reverses under Φ_corr = -ω(r_s·Δh/R²)t

We quantify the expected phase drift across quantum platforms:
- **Superconducting transmons** (5 GHz, 1 mm, 100 μs): ΔΦ ≈ 7×10⁻¹³ rad — 12 orders of magnitude below noise
- **Optical atomic clocks** (429 THz, 1 m, 1 s): ΔΦ ≈ 0.6 rad — directly detectable

We design falsifiable experiments using chip tilts, remote entanglement, and 3D stacks, presenting a statistical framework based on slope fitting and model comparison (M₀, M_SSZ, M_anom) to bound or detect SSZ contributions.

Our analysis emphasizes that null results in today's superconducting platforms are fully consistent with SSZ and place upper bounds on anomalous couplings; detection will be possible in high-coherence systems such as optical-clock networks.
