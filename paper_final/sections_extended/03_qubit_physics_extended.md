# 3. Qubit Physics — Extended Discussion

## 3.1.1 Transmon Circuit: Detailed Physical Description

The transmon qubit is an evolution of the Cooper-Pair-Box (CPB), specifically developed to drastically reduce sensitivity to charge noise. Understanding its operation is crucial for analyzing SSZ effects, as the characteristic frequencies and coherence times determine the magnitude of gravitational phase drift.

### The Josephson Junction

The heart of every superconducting qubit is the Josephson junction—a thin insulating layer (typically aluminum oxide, Al₂O₃) between two superconductors. The physics of this junction is described by the Josephson relations:

The supercurrent through the junction is given by I = I_c × sin(φ), where I_c is the critical current and φ is the phase difference between the superconducting wave functions on both sides. The associated energy is E_J = (Φ₀ × I_c) / (2π), where Φ₀ = h/(2e) ≈ 2.07 × 10⁻¹⁵ Wb is the flux quantum.

Typical values for transmon qubits: I_c ≈ 20-50 nA, corresponding to E_J ≈ 10-30 GHz × h. Precise tuning is achieved through junction size (typically 100-200 nm × 100-200 nm) and oxide thickness (1-2 nm).

### The Shunt Capacitor

The crucial innovation of the transmon compared to the CPB is the large shunt capacitor connected in parallel with the Josephson junction. This capacitor (typically C ≈ 50-100 fF) dominates the total capacitance and reduces the charging energy to E_C = e²/(2C) ≈ 200-300 MHz × h.

The ratio E_J/E_C determines sensitivity to charge noise. In the CPB regime (E_J/E_C ~ 1), fluctuations in the gate charge n_g lead to significant frequency shifts. In the transmon regime (E_J/E_C ~ 50-100), these fluctuations are exponentially suppressed—the frequency varies by only ~10⁻⁶ for a full fluctuation of n_g.

### The Price of Charge Insensitivity

Suppression of charge noise comes at a cost. The transmon's energy levels approach those of a harmonic oscillator, meaning the anharmonicity α = ω₁₂ - ω₀₁ decreases. For a harmonic oscillator, α = 0, which would render the system useless as a qubit (all transitions would have the same frequency).

The transmon's anharmonicity is α ≈ -E_C/ℏ ≈ -200 MHz. This is sufficient to selectively address the |0⟩ → |1⟩ transition without exciting the |1⟩ → |2⟩ transition, but requires careful pulse shaping (typically: Gaussian with DRAG corrections).

## 3.1.2 Coherence Properties: Physical Mechanisms

The coherence times T₁ and T₂ are the critical parameters that determine how long a qubit can store quantum information. For SSZ, T₂ is particularly relevant, as gravitational phase drift appears as a deterministic contribution to dephasing.

### Relaxation (T₁)

The relaxation time T₁ describes the decay of an excited state |1⟩ to the ground state |0⟩. This process is irreversible and involves photon emission. The dominant mechanisms are:

**Purcell effect:** Spontaneous emission into the readout resonator mode. This is minimized through frequency detuning and Purcell filters. The rate is proportional to (g/Δ)² × κ, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling, Δ is the detuning, and κ is the resonator linewidth.

**Dielectric losses:** Absorption by two-level systems (TLS) in oxide interfaces and substrate. These losses scale with the participation ratio of electric field energy in lossy regions.

**Quasiparticles:** Breaking of Cooper pairs by non-thermal quasiparticles generated by cosmic rays or other high-energy processes. The density of these quasiparticles is typically x_qp ~ 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸.

### Dephasing (T₂)

The dephasing time T₂ describes the loss of phase relationship between |0⟩ and |1⟩ components of a superposition. It is often written as T₂ = 1/(1/(2T₁) + 1/T_φ), where T_φ is the pure dephasing time.

**1/f noise:** Low-frequency fluctuations in qubit frequency, typically caused by TLS in oxide layers. The resulting dephasing accumulates as a Gaussian with standard deviation σ_φ ∝ √(t × ln(t/t_min)), where t_min is the lower cutoff time.

**White noise:** High-frequency fluctuations leading to exponential dephasing (Lorentzian spectrum).

**SSZ contribution:** The gravitational phase drift is a deterministic contribution that grows linearly with time: φ_SSZ = ω × ΔD × t. For transmons at Δh = 1 mm and t = 100 μs, this is ~10⁻¹³ rad, about 12 orders of magnitude below the total noise of ~1 rad.

## 3.4.1 Decoherence vs. Drift: Fundamental Difference

The difference between stochastic decoherence and deterministic SSZ drift is not merely quantitative but qualitative. This difference has profound consequences for experimental detection and possible compensation.

### Stochastic Decoherence

Conventional decoherence arises from uncontrolled coupling of the qubit to environmental degrees of freedom. The resulting dynamics is non-unitary and leads to entropy increase. On the Bloch sphere, this manifests as shrinkage of the Bloch vector toward the center (mixed state).

Mathematically, this is described by the Lindblad master equation:

dρ/dt = -i[H, ρ]/ℏ + Σ_k (L_k ρ L_k† - ½{L_k†L_k, ρ})

The Lindblad operators L_k represent different decoherence channels. For pure dephasing, L = √(γ_φ) × σ_z, leading to exponential decay of off-diagonal elements:

ρ₀₁(t) = ρ₀₁(0) × exp(-t/T₂)

### Deterministic SSZ Drift

SSZ drift, in contrast, is a unitary evolution—it does not change the purity of the state but merely rotates it around the z-axis. On the Bloch sphere, the Bloch vector remains on the surface but shifts along the equatorial line.

The evolution is:

|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iφ_SSZ × σ_z/2) |ψ(0)⟩

For an initial superposition |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2:

|ψ(t)⟩ = (|0⟩ + exp(-iφ_SSZ)|1⟩)/√2

### Consequences for Detection

The fundamental difference enables an experimental test: decoherence is characterized by its stochastic nature, SSZ drift by its predictability.

**Decoherence:** Leads to measurement result distributions that become broader than expected from quantum projection noise.

**SSZ drift:** Systematically shifts the mean of the distribution without increasing width. This shift is calculable and can be exactly compensated by an opposite phase rotation.

## 3.5.1 Platform Comparison: Physical Foundations

The dramatic differences in SSZ sensitivity across quantum platforms can be traced to fundamental physical parameters.

### Superconducting Qubits (Transmon)

**Frequency:** ω/(2π) ≈ 5 GHz (microwave range)
**Coherence time:** T₂ ≈ 100 μs
**Typical height difference:** Δh < 10 mm (chip scale)
**SSZ effect:** ΔΦ ≈ 10⁻¹² rad

The low frequency is the dominant factor. Since ΔΦ ∝ ω, the SSZ effect at 5 GHz is about 10⁵× smaller than at optical frequencies.

### Trapped Ions

**Frequency:** ω/(2π) ≈ 10 MHz to 1 GHz (hyperfine) or 10-100 THz (optical)
**Coherence time:** T₂ ≈ 1-10 s (hyperfine), 1-100 ms (optical)
**Typical height difference:** Δh < 1 mm (trap size)
**SSZ effect:** ΔΦ ≈ 10⁻⁹ rad (hyperfine), 10⁻⁵ rad (optical)

Trapped ions offer an interesting middle ground. Hyperfine qubits have long coherence times but low frequencies. Optical transitions (such as the 729 nm transition in ⁴⁰Ca⁺) have higher frequencies but shorter coherence times.

### Optical Atomic Clocks

**Frequency:** ω/(2π) ≈ 429 THz (Sr), 518 THz (Yb)
**Coherence time:** T₂ ≈ 1-10 s
**Typical height difference:** Δh = 0.1-10 m (laboratory to tower)
**SSZ effect:** ΔΦ ≈ 0.1-10 rad

The combination of extremely high frequency and long coherence time makes optical clocks the ideal tool for SSZ detection. The effect is not only measurable but dominates over other error sources.

### NV Centers in Diamond

**Frequency:** ω/(2π) ≈ 2.87 GHz (ground state) or 470 THz (optical)
**Coherence time:** T₂ ≈ 1 ms (at room temperature!)
**Typical height difference:** Δh < 1 mm
**SSZ effect:** ΔΦ ≈ 10⁻¹¹ rad

NV centers are particularly interesting due to their room-temperature coherence, but their frequencies are too low for SSZ detection.

## 3.6.1 Implications for Quantum Computer Design

The analysis of SSZ effects has concrete consequences for the design of future quantum computers, even though the effects are not measurable with current technology.

### Current Generation: Negligible

For all current superconducting quantum computers (IBM, Google, Rigetti, IQM), SSZ effects are completely negligible:

**Typical parameters:**
- Δh < 100 μm (planar chips)
- T₂ < 500 μs
- ω/(2π) ≈ 5 GHz

**SSZ contribution:** < 10⁻¹⁴ rad per gate

This is ~10¹¹× smaller than typical gate errors of ~10⁻³ rad.

### Future Generations: Monitoring Required

With increasing coherence time and possible 3D architectures, SSZ effects could become relevant:

**Scenario 1: Millisecond coherence**
- T₂ = 10 ms (achievable with improved materials)
- Δh = 1 mm (3D chiplet stack)
- SSZ contribution: ~10⁻¹⁰ rad

Still negligible, but no longer astronomically small.

**Scenario 2: Second-scale coherence**
- T₂ = 1 s (requires fundamental breakthroughs)
- Δh = 10 mm (distributed system)
- SSZ contribution: ~10⁻⁷ rad

Begins to become relevant for quantum error correction.

**Scenario 3: Optical quantum computers**
- ω/(2π) = 300-500 THz
- T₂ = 1 s
- Δh = 1 m

SSZ contribution: ~1 rad – **compensation mandatory!**
